Clone the gae-init project to get the code locally on your computer using Git:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init.git phonebook
```

If you are more familiar with Mercurial use:

```bash
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/gae-init/gae-init phonebook
```

This will create a new directory that is called `phonebook`
including another directory called `main` which contains all the source
files, libraries and more.
