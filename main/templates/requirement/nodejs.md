Node.js is used by gae-init to compile CoffeeScript files into JavaScript,
Less files into CSS, and also to minify all the JavaScript dependencies.

Download the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and install it globally on
your system. This includes the [Node Packaged Modules (npm)](https://npmjs.org/)
which is a very easy way to install packages.

After the installation make sure that you are able to run the `npm --version`
command from your terminal.
