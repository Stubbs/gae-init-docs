In order to compile CoffeeScript files into JavaScript, Less files into CSS and
then minify all the JavaScript dependences, gae-init is using CoffeeScript,
Less and UglifyJS compilers respectively.

Download the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and install it globally on
your system. This installation also includes the
[Node Packaged Modules](https://npmjs.org/) which is a very easy way to install
packages.

After the installation make sure that you are able to run the `npm --help`
command from your terminal.
