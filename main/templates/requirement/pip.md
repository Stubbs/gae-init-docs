To install or upgrade pip, securely download
[get-pip.py](https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py).
Then run the following (which may require administrator access):

```bash
$ python get-pip.py
```

After the installation make sure that you are able to run the `pip --version`
command from your terminal.
